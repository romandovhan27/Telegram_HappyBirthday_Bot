"""
Important information
I use pythonanywhere as the server. It offers so called "scheduled tasks". Basically that's the script that is executed
everyday at a specific time. I have a file called scheduled_task.py which is executed everyday at 7:00 (UTC time zone).
However it is also possible to achieve the same result using threading. At the end of this file there is a commented
block of code. It uses threading to do the job. So if you don't have the opportunity to execute the scheduled_task.py
script you can use this code.
